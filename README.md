# picamframegrid
A simple multi-webcam framegrab grid display service for Wyze RTSP or other HD-only cam streams that runs reliably on a Raspberry Pi 3b


## Installation
To install the `picamframegrid` service, you can copypasta the following line into your SSH terminal session:
```
git clone https://github.com/free5ty1e/picamframegrid.git && pushd picamframegrid && ./scripts/camgridinstall.sh && popd
```

This will only work on an `xfce` desktop right now so if you have another installed it may not work.  YMMV, and feel free to submit improvements - like other desktops support with a setting in the `conf` file, or perhaps without a desktop...


## Current implementation
* Is a service that utilizes multiple (give it a list) ffmpeg RTSP streams from Wyze cams (1080p only, no low-res streams are available via RTSP as far as I know so this breaks all other Pi cam grid repos that I am aware of - such as `camplayer` https://github.com/raspicamplayer/camplayer and which utilizes `omxplayer` and also two custom `vlc` configs, mosaic implementation and multi-window - as soon as it tries to display two of my Wyze cams simultaneously it blanks out or flashes horribly in a seizure-inducing manner).
* (DIRECT TO FRAMEBUFFER METHOD - NEW) These `ffmpeg` instances write their frames directly to the provided position on the screen / in the framebuffer (positions are provided in lists in the conf file along with the stream URLs in 2 additional arrays), which displays directly without an intermediate file or a need to compile multiple framegrabs into a single image.
* (DESKTOP METHOD - OLD) These `ffmpeg` instances write their frames to the `/ramdisk` folder, which is currently a `30MB` RAM drive set up with the following `/etc/fstab` entry:
```
cambuffer /ramdisk tmpfs size=30M,noatime,nodev,nosuid,noexec,nodiratime 0 0
```
* (DESKTOP METHOD - OLD) The frames are by default captured in `.tiff` format as it seemed to be the most reliable and fastest so far but can easily choose `.jpg` or `.bmp`.  The format you choose in the conf file (`/home/pi/.camgrid/camgrid.conf`) will be also utilized for the grid image format.
* Capture size for each frame is by default `640x480` but you can change it in the conf file.
* `gpu_mem=64` specifies the size of the GPU memory I am allocating in `/boot/config.txt`
* I've disabled the swapfile entirely with the following commands:
```
sudo dphys-swapfile swapoff && sudo dphys-swapfile uninstall && sudo update-rc.d dphys-swapfile remove && sudo systemctl disable dphys-swapfile
```
* I've installed `log2ram` ( https://github.com/azlux/log2ram ) to really minimize SD card write cycles, and adjusted the log size to `30MB` and enabled the `ram compression with the following setting in `/etc/log2ram.conf`:
```
SIZE=30M
# **************** Zram backing conf  *************************************************

# ZL2R Zram Log 2 Ram enables a zram drive when ZL2R=true ZL2R=false is mem only tmpfs
ZL2R=true
# COMP_ALG this is any compression algorithm listed in /proc/crypto
# lz4 is fastest with lightest load but deflate (zlib) and Zstandard (zstd) give far better compression ratios
# lzo is very close to lz4 and may with some binaries have better optimisation
# COMP_ALG=lz4 for speed or Zstd for compression, lzo or zlib if optimisation or availabilty is a problem
COMP_ALG=Zstd
# LOG_DISK_SIZE is the uncompressed disk size. Note zram uses about 0.1% of the size of the disk when not in use
# LOG_DISK_SIZE is expected compression ratio of alg chosen multiplied by log SIZE
# lzo/lz4=2.1:1 compression ratio zlib=2.7:1 zstandard=2.9:1
# Really a guestimate of a bit bigger than compression ratio whilst minimising 0.1% mem usage of disk size
LOG_DISK_SIZE=40M
```
* `inotifywait` is utilized in another thread to watch for changes to the framegrab files, which triggers the frames to be assembled 
* frames are being assembled via the `imagemagick` `montage` command in an a/b file pattern to `/ramdisk` and then these a/b images are being set as the `xfce` desktop background for a seamless frame update experience
* The system auto logs into the desktop and starts the service, triggered by a custom `xsession.trigger` that I added to kick off the service once the desktop session has started - can just connect up to a monitor and watch your cameras after booting it up anywhere with network.
* Can use the standard `/boot/wpa_supplicant.conf` to tell a Pi with wifi to auto connect to your network, here's an example article on how to do this: https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2017/04/manually-setting-up-pi-wifi-using-wpa_supplicant-conf/


## Performance

The `direct_to_framebuffer` method (NEW): 
* I am displaying 2 of my Wyze cams in a side-by-side configuration, top-left and top-right of the screen
* Handles up to 2fps with 2 HD Wyze cam streams like this just fine,
*   ...however, raising to 3fps in this configuration appears to raise one of the `ffmpeg` instances up to 100% cpu and the other seems to not ever update frames, so additional work will be required to move past this limit ðŸ¤”
* Each `ffmpeg` instance appears to eat up ~10-20% CPU time / ~4-5% memory at 1/5fps (5 seconds per frame) (on a Pi 3b at stock clock)
*   ...and ~20-35% CPU time / ~5% memory at 2fps


The `desktop_xfce` method (OLD, was before I added option to only process non-keyframes):

* I am displaying 2 of my Wyze cams in a side-by-side grid
* Handles 4 seconds / frame without thermal throttling on a Raspberry Pi 3b with passive cooling / stock clock with ambient room temperature (~70*F)
* Thermal throttling occurs at anything faster than 3 seconds / frame in this configuration, but it still seems to work even at 1fps (fastest I've tried so far)



I will post more info about my findings on how reliable / performant this is on various Raspberry Pi's as I get a chance to test them.  I even have a Pi Zero W here that should be able to handle this task in some capacity.



## Coming Soon:
* Pre-built Raspberry Pi image, just edit the `/home/pi/.camgrid/camgrid.conf` file to set it up and then `camgridrestartservice.sh`
* Better documentation, I guess
* Testing various potential improvements such as: 
*   attempting to optimize ffmpeg settings to use less memory / cpu
*   trying various frame capture sizes and montage arrangements
*   Anything else people may suggest
